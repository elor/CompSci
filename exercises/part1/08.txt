a) equilibrium
  = 0.444... atoms/AU (area unit)
  
  averages don't drift:
    automatically fulfilled, since it's the criteria for equilibrium
    
b) conservation of energy, ideal gas ratio
  PV/NkT = 1.6... / k
  k?
  
  k=1 => 3 times greater

c) density scaling
  expectations: P and T will increase
  
  PV/NT decreases until it reaches 1
  P and T increase

d)
  see LJParticlesAppTvsE
  
e)
  T(E) increases linearly
  dE/dT = 80.791
  
  T depends solely on Ekin, thus reducing the influence of Epot on Cv to 0%.
  
f)
  theoretically, the Method in e should be more accurate.
  Cv = 83.252
