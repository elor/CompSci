a)
  Numerical solution introduced (RK4, two ghosts). Comparison yields no differences.
  
b)
  n=3:
  Initial displacement is sinusoidal with 1.5 periods.
  Displacements oscillate. No differences to analytical solution.
  
  n=8: symmetric, but seemingly chaotic displacements, which still follow the sinusoidal construction rule.
  Displacements still oscillate. No differences to analytical solution.

  The system seemingly remains in normal mode, though differences to analytical solution slowly increase over time.
  
  The particles seem to be moving chaotically or oscillating independently, though a combination of different modes seems more likely.
  
 c)
  It yields a normal mode solution.
  
  There are N+2 atoms (2 ghosts) in a fixed bc, which equals N+1 springs.
  Since there are no effective ghosts particles, but just ghost images, there are N-1 springs plus 1 spring to connect both ends, totaling N springs.
  
  Only even values of n give normal modes.
  
  free:
  From the looks of it, the normal modes are at least not sinusoidal, if they are sinusoidal at all.
  However, the oscillations show a very large period, which becomes clearer when watching the ends of the chain. 
  
  reflection:
  fixed: 180 deg
  free: 0 deg
