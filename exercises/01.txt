Exercise 1:

a)
  Rmax = 23.122 (analytical: 22.935)

b)
  Larger to compensate for the height offset. Imagine a Ball that's thrown with \delta=45deg from pos=[<0, 0]. The angle flattens as it reaches 2m.

  \delta_{max} = 35deg

c) 
  optimal angle, computed with modified prog: 30deg (C2=0.7)
  -> lower angle, my dear Watson.

  C2=0.1 => 35deg

d)
  Velocities aren't coupled, so they hit the floor with the same velocity at
  the same time.

e)
  vx and vy are coupled, so drag slows second ball (vx != 0) in y direction.

  Tests with given values:
    falling ball: 1.68 s
    thrown ball:  1.90 s

f)
  vx and vy aren't coupled anymore, hence the balls fall with the same vy.
    falling ball: 2.13
    thrown ball:  2.13

YAY
