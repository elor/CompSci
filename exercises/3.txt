a)
  What would be orbits without interaction?
    -> elliptic
    T_i = 2 \pi \sqrt{a^3/GM_i}
      a - Radius (hier Kreisbahnen, sonst elliptischer Parameter a)

  qualitative effect:
    orbital distortions
    possibly mutual synchronization

  shapes:
    near-elliptic
    outer planet moves on a stable orbit
    inner planet moves on unstable orbit, possibly synchronizing with the outer planet

  inner planet is affected due to lower mass

  angular momentum:
    no conservation. Stronly depends on lighter planet
  total energy:
